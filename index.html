                <span class="text-muted">Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a main repository for project files. It allows team members, whether they be in a classroom, or in the workforce, to edit the file simultaneously without messing up the file with two different edits. The way this is done is that the team member must check the file out, make their changes and check it back in. This topic interests me and is applicable to my own life because it is likely the method my future office will be using when multiple programmers are working on the same website or program. This is relevant to our course because we will need to learn to work on programs with other people in the class because that is how we will need to work with our coworkers in the future.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Versioning Control System (VCS)</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Versioning Control System (VCS) is a system of files that when edited, it notes who changed the files, when they were changed, what part of them are new, and can merge the changes to the old file. The files cannot be overwritten, it will save all the different versions of the file. People can work on the same file at the same time with no issues. It also allows you to revert back to older versions of the file if needed. This topic interests me because it is a very convenient way to both work with others and have my work backed up constantly. This is relevant to our course because we are learning how to use a VCS in this lesson and for the rest of the semester.   </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a VCS that is through a website. An account on git is free and allows you to handle from small to very large projects. Git has a fast processor, you work off of it locally, and every user has a total copy of the files stored on their machine locally. Git has many commands you can enter into your terminal that perform different functions. Some commands are git init, git log, git status, git push, and more. This topic interests me because it will create a portfolio of my work that I can put on my resume that could very well help me get a job later in life. The topic is relevant to the course because we will be using Git throughout the semester to store our websites. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> A repository is a storage location that is installed on a computer and can be retrieved. Git essentially is a repository that will hold all of our files. You are able to either initialize a repository from an existing directory or clone an existing repository in git. Some are free, like git, while others require a monthly subscription of money. This topic interest me because repositories are a crucial backup to have while programming important things. It is great knowledge for me to learn for my future career. This is relevant to our course because we are using a git repository to back up our files.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git commands are different commands that you input into your unix terminal in order to perform functions to your git repository. The command "git commit" records your changes to the repository. The command "git branch" lists, creates, or deletes branches. The command "git checkout" switches between branches. The command "git reset" moves HEAD and the current branch to wherever you specify. These commands interest me because they are very useful to know for both this class and my career in the future. This topic is relevant to the course because we need to know these commands in order to manipulate our git repository properly.  </p>
